# Travel-Rewards-System
Conceptual system design created for my T INFO 360 (Information Systems Analysis & Design) class during Fall 2020. The purpose of this project was to conceptualize a system that could integrate credit card reward points with a modern flight finder. While credit card companies have their own steps to redeem reward points for flights, the process lacks the simplicity and efficiency. Our main goals for this project were to improve the current system to be more user-friendly and time-efficient when redeeming credit card reward points for commercial flights. Alongside two other individuals within the class, I lead the group in creating conceptualizing, documenting, and organizing a plan that could realisticaly lead to the development of our intended system.
